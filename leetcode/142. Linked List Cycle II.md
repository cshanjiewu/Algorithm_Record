### Linked List Cycle II

#### Problem

Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

**Note:** Do not modify the linked list.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

```c++
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *detectCycle(ListNode *head) {
        // first detect wheather there is a loop
        // second using the pointer that point to the node they meet
        // and the point to the head
        // from the meet node to starting of loop == from head node to the starting of loop
        ListNode* fast = head;
        ListNode* slow = head;
        
        while(fast && slow && fast->next){
            fast = fast->next->next;
            slow = slow->next;
            if(fast == slow){
                slow = head;
                while(slow != fast){
                    slow = slow->next;
                    fast = fast->next;
                }
                return fast;
            }
        }
        return NULL;
        
    }
};
