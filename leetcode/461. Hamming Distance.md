###  Hamming Distance

#### Problem

The [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers `x` and `y`, calculate the Hamming distance.

**Note:**
0 ≤ `x`, `y` < 231.

**Example:**

```
Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

#### Solution

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        if(x == y) return 0;
        int count = 0;
        int x_bit = 0;
        int y_bit = 0;
        while(x != 0 || y != 0){
            if(x == 0){
                x_bit = 0;
            }else{
                x_bit = x % 2;
            }
            x = x / 2;
            
            if(y == 0){
                y_bit = 0;
            }else{
                y_bit = y % 2;
            }
            y = y / 2;
            
            if(x_bit != y_bit) count++;
            
        }
        return count;
        
    }
};
```
