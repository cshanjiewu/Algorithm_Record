### Container With Most Water

#### Problem

Given *n* non-negative integers *a1*, *a2*, ..., *an* , where each represents a point at coordinate (*i*, *ai*). *n* vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line *i*is at (*i*, *ai*) and (*i*, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Note:** You may not slant the container and *n* is at least 2.

**Example:**

```
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
```

#### Solution

Using two variable to indicate the left side and right side of rectangle. And every time we move the shorter side to the middle. Through this method, we can traverse the possible max value.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int size = height.size();
        if(size == 2){
            int x = min(height[0], height[1]);
            return x*1;
        }
        // use two variable to store the left side and the right side of the rectangle
        int start = 0;
        int end = size - 1;
        int max_result = 0;
        // move the shorter side to the middle in order to get the possible max value
        while(start < end){
            if(height[start] < height[end]){
                max_result = max(max_result, height[start] * (end - start));
                start++;
            }else{
                max_result = max(max_result, height[end] * (end - start));
                end--;
            }
        }
        return max_result;
    }
};
```

**Explanation**

The common confuse in this algorithm is that weather moving the shorter side in rectangle each time will lead to a local optimum. But just as the explanation shown below, the purpose of moving the shorter side is to get the every possible max value. We can see the matrix that each 'o' can represent more than one case.
