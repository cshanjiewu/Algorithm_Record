### Unique Paths

#### Problem

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a *m* x *n* grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28
```

#### Solution

fundamental DP problem. Since the robot can only move down and right, when it arrives at a point, there only two possible situations:

1. it arrives at the point from above(moving down to the target)
2. it arrives at the point from left(moving right to the target)

we suppose the number of unique paths to arrive a point (i, j) is denoted as P[i,j], it is easily conclude that P[i,j] = P[i,j-1] + P[i-1,j]. The boundary condition of the above equation occur at the leftmost column and the uppermost row.P[0,j] = 1, P[i,0] = 1

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        if(m == 1 || n == 1){
            return 1;
        }
        // p[i,j] = p[i-1,j] + p[i,j-1]
        // need two variable to store the last column value and the left value of the target
        vector<int> lastColumn(n, 1);
        int left = 1;
        // DP
        for(int i = 1; i < m; i++){
            for(int j = 1; j < n; j++){
                if(j == 1) left = 1;
                left = left + lastColumn[j];
                lastColumn[j] = left;
            }
        }
        return lastColumn[n-1];
        
    }
};
```
