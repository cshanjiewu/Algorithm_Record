### Sort Colors

#### Problem

Given an array with *n* objects colored red, white or blue, sort them **in-place** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

**Note:** You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

**Example:**

```
Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

**Follow up:**

- A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
  First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
- Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?

#### Solution

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
        
        // index l to indicate the 0's area
        // index h to indicate the 2's area
        // index m to indicate the 1's area
        int l = 0;
        int m = 0;
        int h = nums.size() - 1;
        
        while(nums[l] == 0) l++;
        m = l;
        while(nums[h] == 2) h--;
        
        while(m <= h){
            if(nums[m] == 0 || nums[m] == 2){
                if(nums[m] == 0){
                    swap(nums[l],nums[m]);
                    l++;
                    m++;
                }else if(nums[m] == 2){
                    swap(nums[m], nums[h]);
                    h--;
                }
            }else{
                m++;
            }
            
        }
        
        
    }
};
```
