### Unique Binary Search Trees

#### Problem 

Given *n*, how many structurally unique **BST's** (binary search trees) that store values 1 ... *n*?

**Example:**

```
Input: 3
Output: 5
Explanation:
Given n = 3, there are a total of 5 unique BST's:

   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \
     3     2     1      1   3      2
    /     /       \                 \
   2     1         2                 3
```

#### Solution

Given a sorted sequence **1.....n** to construct a Binary Search Tree out of sequence, we could enumerate each number **i** in the sequence, and use the number as the root, then, the subsequence **1......(i-1)** on its left side would lay on the left branch of the root, and similarity the right subsequence **(i+1).....n** lay on the right branch of the root. We then can construct the subtree from the subsequence recursively.

As we can see, the problem can be reduced into problems with smaller sizes, instead of recursively solve the subproblems, we can store the solution of subproblems and reuse them later, i.e. the dynamic programming way

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int numTrees(int n) {
        // G[0] G[1]
        int G[n+1] = {0};
        // attention g[0] == 1
        G[0] = 1;
        G[1] = 1;
        
        if(n <= 1) return G[n];
        
        for(int i = 2; i <= n; i++){
            for(int j = 1; j <= i; j++){
                G[i] = G[i] + G[j - 1]*G[i-j];
            }
        }
        return G[n];
        
        
    }
};
```
