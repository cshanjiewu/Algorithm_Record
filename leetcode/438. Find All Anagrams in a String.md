### Find All Anagrams in a String

#### Problem

Given a string **s** and a **non-empty** string **p**, find all the start indices of **p**'s anagrams in **s**.

Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings **s** and **p** will not be larger than 20,100.

The order of output does not matter.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
s: "cbaebabacd" p: "abc"

Output:
[0, 6]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input:
s: "abab" p: "ab"

Output:
[0, 1, 2]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
```

#### Solution

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findAnagrams(string s, string p) {
        vector<int> result;
        if(s.size() == 0 || p.size() == 0) result;
        vector<int> letter(26, 0);
        for(int i = 0; i < p.size(); i++){
            letter[p[i] - 'a']++;
        }
        int left = 0;
        int right = 0;
        int count = p.size();
        while(right < s.size()){
            if(letter[s[right++] - 'a']-- >= 1) count--;
            if(count == 0) result.push_back(left);
            if(right - left == p.size() && letter[s[left++] - 'a']++ >= 0) count++;
        }
        return result;
        
    }
};
```
